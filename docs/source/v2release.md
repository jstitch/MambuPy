Announcing the stable release of **MambuPy v2.0**

Today's a great day for the MambuPy project, after several years of development we are finally publicly announcing an official release for it.

MambuPy is a *Python* library designed to interact with the [Mambu API](https://api.mambu.com/).
The basic conceptual idea behind MambuPy is to be a library that provides an abstraction layer over Mambu's REST API, simplifying common tasks such as managing clients, groups, loans, among others.

It is designed to be easy to use while maintaining the flexibility needed for complex financial operations, abstracting low-level details.

It's full-featured for interacting with Mambu's REST API, and also with a Mambu's database backup. It has been used in production by devteams in financial institutions and now it releases its official version for Mambu's REST API v2.

You can install it via PyPi: [https://pypi.org/project/MambuPy/](https://pypi.org/project/MambuPy/)
