    Makes two calls to Mambu API:

    - a POST to request a backup to be made
    - a GET, once the backup is ready, to download the latest backup

    * callback is a string to a callback URL Mambu will internally call
    when the backup is ready to download. You should have a webservice
    there to warn you when the backup is ready.

    * bool_func is a function you use against your own code to test if the
    said backup is ready. This function backup_db manages both the logic
    of the request of a backup and the downloading of it too, so
    bool_func allows you to have some way on your side to know when this
    function will download the backup.

    The thing is you have to build a webservice (for the callback)
    making some kind of flag turn that your bool_func will read and know
    when to say True, telling backup_db to begin the download of the
    backup.

    * output_fname the name of the file that will hold the downloaded
    backup. PLEASE MIND that Mambu sends a ZIP file here.

    * user, pwd and url allow you to change the Mambu permissions for
    the getmambuurl internally called here.

    * verbose is a boolean flag for verbosity.

    * retries number of retries for bool_func or -1 for keep waiting.

    * force_download_latest boolean, True to force download even if no
    callback is called. False to throw error if callback isn't received
    after retries.

    * returns a dictionary with info about the download
        -latest     boolean flag, if the db downloaded was the latest or not
