"""Mambu Loans objects.

MambuLoan holds a loan account.

MambuLoans holds a list of loan accounts.

Uses mambuutil.getloans as default urlfunc.
You can override this and use mambuutil.getgrouploansurl for the loans
of a specific group instead (you should send the Group ID instead of the
Loan ID as the entid argument in the constructor in that case).

        Holder may be a MambuClient or a MambuGroup object, depending on

        getRoles argument tells this method to retrive the clients who
        have specific roles in the group, in case of a group holder.

        getClients argument tells this method to retrieve the client
        members of the group, in case of a group holder. See the
        definition of the 'clients' field added with this argument
        below.

        fullDetails argument works for Client Holder and for the client
        members of the group. But the Group is always retrieved with
        full details.

        When using getRoles argument also adds a 'roles' field to the
        holder, a dictionary with keys:

        * 'role' , the rolename

        * 'client', a MambuClient having that role on the group

        TODO: since the roles field is added to the holder, and it only
        applies to Groups, perhaps the getRoles functionality should be
        on MambuGroup code

        When using getClients argument, also adds a 'clients' field to
        the loan. By the way it works, when holder is a Group, it calls
        the setClients method, which adds a 'clients' field to the
        MambuGroup.

        The 'clients' field on the loan is a dictionary with the full
        name of each client receiving from this loan account as a key
        (see the 'name' field on MambuClient and MambuGroup). Each key
        holds another dictionary with the following keys:

        * 'client' holds a MambuClient. So even if a group is the holder
        of the account, you can access each individual client object
        here.

        * 'loan' holds a reference to this loan account (self)

        * 'amount' defaults to the total loan amount ('loanAmount'
        field) (see the pydoc for getClientDetails method)

        * 'montoPago' defaults to the total loan amount divided by the
        number of repayment installments of the loan account (the
        'repaymentInstallments' field), that is, how much to pay for
        each repayment installment (see the pydoc for getClientDetails
        method)
        TODO: change the name to an english name

        * 'porcentaje' defaults to a 100%, the total loan amount divided
        by itself, that is, hoy much in percentage of the debt belongs
        to this client (see the pydoc for getClientDetails method)
        TODO: change the name to an english name

        This three fields are supposed to reflect individual numbers for
        each client, but Mambu does an awful job indicating this on
        group loan accounts. So you should indicate how much you
        assigned to each client in other ways. Using the notes of the
        loan account perhaps (with a predefined format you parse on the
        preprocessing of MambuLoan)? with custom fields? Your call that
        you may define making your own loan account class inheriting
        from MambuLoan class. See the pydoc for getClientDetails method
        below, it specifies the way to determine the amount for each
        client depending on your use of Mambu, and additionally any
        other fields you wish to add to the 'clients' field on the loan
        account.

        You iterate over each element of the responded List from Mambu,
        and create a Mambu Loan (or your own itemclass) object for each
        one, initializing them one at a time, and changing the attrs
        attribute (which just holds a list of plain dictionaries) with a
        MambuLoan (or your own itemclass) just created.

        TODO: pass a valid (perhaps default) urlfunc, and its
        corresponding id to entid to each itemclass, telling MambuStruct
        not to connect() by default. It's desirable to connect at any
        other further moment to refresh some element in the list.
