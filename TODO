# TODO

-Unittests for ALL of the code (aiming to do TDD from now on...)

-Translation, of certain code and almost all comments to english

-Better configuration

-Remove old json comments on each mambu struct (perhaps change them to a more general thing, as an aid to developers?)

-A LOT of functionality from Mambu APIs
