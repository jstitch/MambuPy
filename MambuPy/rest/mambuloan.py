                getRoles argument tells this method to retrive the clients who
                have specific roles in the group, in case of a group holder.

                getClients argument tells this method to retrieve the client
                members of the group, in case of a group holder. See the
                definition of the 'clients' field added with this argument
                below.

                fullDetails argument works for Client Holder and for the client
                members of the group. But the Group is always retrieved with
                full details.

                When using getRoles argument also adds a 'roles' field to the
                holder, a dictionary with keys:

                * 'role' , the rolename

                * 'client', a MambuClient having that role on the group

        .. todo:: since the roles field is added to the holder, and it only
                  applies to Groups, perhaps the getRoles functionality should be
                  on MambuGroup code

                When using getClients argument, also adds a 'clients' field to
                the loan. By the way it works, when holder is a Group, it calls
                the setClients method, which adds a 'clients' field to the
                MambuGroup.

                The 'clients' field on the loan is a dictionary with the full
                name of each client receiving from this loan account as a key
                (see the 'name' field on MambuClient and MambuGroup). Each key
                holds another dictionary with the following keys:

                * 'client' holds a MambuClient. So even if a group is the holder
                  of the account, you can access each individual client object
                  here.

                * 'loan' holds a reference to this loan account (self)

                * 'amount' defaults to the total loan amount ('loanAmount'
                  field) (see the pydoc for getClientDetails method)

                * 'montoPago' defaults to the total loan amount divided by the
                  number of repayment installments of the loan account (the
                  'repaymentInstallments' field), that is, how much to pay for
                  each repayment installment (see the pydoc for getClientDetails
                  method)

        .. todo:: change the name to an english name

                * 'porcentaje' defaults to a 100%, the total loan amount divided
                  by itself, that is, hoy much in percentage of the debt belongs
                  to this client (see the pydoc for getClientDetails method)

        .. todo:: change the name to an english name

                This three fields are supposed to reflect individual numbers for
                each client, but Mambu does an awful job indicating this on
                group loan accounts. So you should indicate how much you
                assigned to each client in other ways. Using the notes of the
                loan account perhaps (with a predefined format you parse on the
                preprocessing of MambuLoan)? with custom fields? Your call that
                you may define making your own loan account class inheriting
                from MambuLoan class. See the pydoc for getClientDetails method
                below, it specifies the way to determine the amount for each
                client depending on your use of Mambu, and additionally any
                other fields you wish to add to the 'clients' field on the loan
                account.

    With the default urlfunc, entid argument must be empty at
    instantiation time to retrieve all the loan accounts according to
    any other filter you send to the urlfunc.

    There's another possible urlfunc you may use, getgrouploansurl. If
    you use that, you should send the ID of the group from which you
    wish to retrieve its loan accounts.

    itemclass argument allows you to pass some other class as the
    elements for the list. Why is this useful? at least for now,
    MambuLoan is the most specialized class on MambuPy. So you may
    wish to override several behaviours by creating your own
    MambuLoan son class. Pass that to the itemclass argument here
    and voila, you get a list of YourMambuLoan class using
    MambuLoans instead of plain old MambuLoan elements.

    If you wish to specialize other Mambu objects on MambuPy you may
    do that. Mind that if you desire that the iterable version of it
    to have elements of your specialized class, you need to change
    the logic of the constructor and the convertDict2Attrs method in
    the iterable class to use some sort of itemclass there too.
    Don't forget to submit the change on a pull request when done
