        Caching singleton. You may not wish to retrieve from Mambu all the
        products every time you need to use them, so you can use this, which
        requests from Mambu one time only, and holds them here forever
        during your python session.

        To use it, instead of instantiating a MambuProducts() object when
        needing all the products from Mambu, instantiate an
        AllMambuProducts() object and the caching will be used by default.

    .. todo:: is there a better way to implement cache directly on
              MambuProducts()?

        Why have a cache? because Mambu products are not likely to change
        once you have them configured in Mambu. So it's better to prevent a
        lot of requests to get the same information over and over again.

        You are free to implement caches such as this on any other Mambu
        objects if you find it useful (perhaps groups or branches or any
        other Mambu entity do not change a lot on your own business?).
        Please try to be consistent on names and functionality.
