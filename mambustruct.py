"""Base class for all Mambu objects.

Includes functionality to download such objects using GET requests to
Mambu, and to POST requests to Mambu.

Some caching may be achieved. Please look at caching done at
mambuproduct.AllMambuProducts class for an example of how caching should
be done.

Official Mambu dev documentation at Mambu Developer Center:
https://developer.mambu.com

You must configure your Mambu client in mambuconfig.py Please read the
pydocs there for more information.

Some basic definitions:

* MambuStruct refers to the parent class of all Mambu Objects and

* MambuPy Mambu objects refers to any child of MambuStruct, usually
defined at some mambu-somename- python module file. Sometimes referred
as implemented MambuStruct or something fancy

* Mambu entity refers to an entity retrieved via a request via Mambu
REST API. It's a more abstract thing in fact. Also may refer to entities
on a relational database but the term table is preferred in this case.

        datetime, etc.

        Basically it stores the response on the attrs attribute, then
        runs some customizable preprocess method, then runs
        convertDict2Attrs method to convert the string elements to an
        adequate python object, then a customizable postprocess method.

        It also executes each method on the 'methods' attribute given on
        instantiation time, and sets new customizable 'properties' to
        the object.

        Why not on __init__? two reasons:

        * __init__ optionally connects to Mambu, if you don't connect to
        Mambu, the Mambu object will be configured but it won't have any
        Mambu info on it. Only when connected, the Mambu object will be
        initialized, here.

        Useful to POST several times the same Mambu object. You make a
        POST request over and over again by calling it's connect()
        method every time you wish. This init method will configure the
        response in to the attrs attribute each time.

        You may also wish to update the info on a previously initialized
        Mambu object and refresh it with what Mambu now has. Instead of
        building a new object, you just connect() again and it will be
        refreshed.

        * Iterable Mambu objects (lists) do not initialize here, the
        iterable Mambu object __init__ goes through each of its elements
        and then initializes with this code one by one. Please look at

        Perfect example: custom fields on certain objects is a mess
        (IMHO) when retrieved from Mambu, so some easiness is
        implemented here to access them. See some of this objects
        modules and pydocs for further info.

        Tasks done here:

        - Each custom field is given a 'name' key that holds the field
        name, and for each keyed name, the value of the custom field is
        assigned. Each pair of custom field name/value is entered as a
        new property on the main dictionary, allowing an easy access to
        them, not nested inside a pretty dark 'customInformation/Values'
        list.

        - Every item on the attrs dictionary gets stripped from trailing
        spaces (useful when users make typos).

        PLEASE REMEMBER! whenever you call postprocess on inherited
        classes you should call this method too, or else you lose the
        effect of the tasks done here.
